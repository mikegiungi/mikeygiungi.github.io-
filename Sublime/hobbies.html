        <p> My hobbies include playing sports, cooking, and going to the gym. These have always been my hobbies because growing up I always played sports and part of that was lifting weights and I really grew a passion for the two. The cooking aspect came into play because I learned that in order to do well on the field and grow muscle you have to have the proper nutrients, so I began to cook my own meals and ever since then I have been doing so, even when I am back home over winter and summer break. Sometimes I will cook dinner for my family when they are busy and don't have time to cook or I like to surprise them when they come home from work. Overall I am very happy I found these hobbies because they are things I will do for the rest of my life.</p>
