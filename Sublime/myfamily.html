        <p> This is my family. In my family there are a total of five people. I have a Mom and Dad as well as three brothers. My mom is Elizabeth and my dad is Eduard. Out of all the siblings in my family I am the youngest. My oldest brother is Daniel and my middle brother is Brandon. Their are five years between each of us. My oldest brother is 30, my middle brother is 25, and I'm 20. My Mom and Dad have been togather since they were 15 years old. We spend a lot of time togather when I am home because I am in Maine for most of the year, besides winter and summer break.</p>
