        <p> This is my hometown West Hartford, CT. My family and I have lived here most of our lives. Originally my parents imigrated from Italy when they were 15 years old and then my two brothers and I were the only ones born in America. West Hartford is a rather large town with a population around 63,000 people. The overall climate of the town and state is rather cold in the winter (not like Maine though!) and gets very hot in the spring and summer. Through my 19 years of living in the town I have really enjoyed it and am going to miss it a lot when I end up moving out</p>
